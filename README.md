# Dillon-3802-final-project

## important files

final_project.ipynb - has time info for some runs 

final_project.pyx - cython code. current calls the C implementation of bubble sort from bubblesort.c

bubblesort.c - C code for bubblesort taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/ modified to read input from files generated by generate_test_files.py

generate_test_files.py - generates a list of random numbers of various lengths and writes them to .txt files (for example 100.txt, 1000.txt, ect.) ...
                            this allows input to the sorting arrays to stay consistent between languages and runs

setup.py - used to generate cython code

run.py - run the code generated by cython


## C commands

compile C code:
    gcc -Wall bubblesort.c -o bubblesort
run C code:
    ./bubblesort
    
## How to buld and run Cython (code is in final_proejct.pyx):

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

python run.py
